Reading the Input Image: load the input image using cv2.imread(input_image_path).
Converting to Grayscale: The gray = cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY) line converts the image to grayscale. Grayscale images are easier to work with for certain tasks.
Applying Adaptive Thresholding:  apply adaptive thresholding to obtain a binary image (binary). Adaptive thresholding helps segment the image into foreground (text/logo) and background regions.
Finding Contours: The contours, _ = cv2.findContours(binary, cv2.RETR_EXTERNAL, cv2.CHAIN_APPROX_SIMPLE) line finds contours in the binary image. Contours represent the boundaries of connected components.
Defining the Template Image (Logo): load the template image (template) containing the logo you want to remove.
Iterating Through Contours: For each contour, you check if its area is similar to the template area and if the aspect ratio is close to 1. If these conditions are met, you proceed to the next steps.
Resizing the Template:  resize the template to match the size of the contour.
Calculating Correlation: The correlation = cv2.matchTemplate(gray[y:y+h, x:x+w], template_resized, cv2.TM_CCOEFF_NORMED) line calculates the correlation between the contour region and the resized template.
Replacing the Logo Region: If the correlation coefficient is above a threshold (0.7 in your case), you replace the logo region in the original image with the background color (average color of the surrounding pixels).
Saving the Output Image: Finally, save the modified image using cv2.imwrite(output_image_path, img).
